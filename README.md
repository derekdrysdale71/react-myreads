# MyReads Project
---

MyReads is my implementation of the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running App

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Using the App
* Books are sorted into three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read
* To change a book's category or remove a book from the list, click on the down arrow on the book cover
* To add new books, click on the '+' button at the bottom of the page

*Note: The backend API is limited to a fixed set of [search terms](#search-terms)
