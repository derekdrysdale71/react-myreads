# MyReads Project

MyReads is my implementation of the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running App

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
